This is a conceptual project for a car workshop, done in Lucidchart.

The requirements were:
- The DB would be used for the control and management of service orders;
- The clients bring their cars to the workshop to repair or periodic inspection. These are specified in the DB by a binary type;
- Each vehicle is designated to a team of employees for identification and service excecution. The team must fill a service order with deadline;
- Based on the service order, the final cost is given consulting a components table and a labor table;
- The client must authorize the service excecution;
- A service order may have many services and components and an unique service or components may be in different orders.
